# Application Info

This Android app shows information about the applications stored on your device and optionally about the Android build, memory, and application permissions.  Its primary purpose is to let you save this information to the SD card.  For the downloaded applications in particular, it lets you keep track of what you installed in case the phone is broken or a hard reset is performed.
